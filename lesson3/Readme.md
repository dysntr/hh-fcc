# Lesson 3: Remix Storage Factory

- [Lesson Link](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js#lesson-3-remix-storage-factory)

## My Notes

- Composability - ability for contracts to interact with each other.
- Different ways to interact with other contracts:

  - Copy the contract
  - Using import
  - Create an interface
  - Call it with contract address and abi (application binary interface)

- Inheritance
  - In order for a function to be overrideable you need to add "virtual" modifier to the function. The overwriting function needs the modifier "override".
